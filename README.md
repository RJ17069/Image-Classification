Image Classification Using Tensorflow


Image classification using TensorFlow typically involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model that excels at processing and classifying visual data. TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework that provides tools for building and training such models. Below is a simple example of image classification using TensorFlow and Keras, which is a high-level API integrated into TensorFlow.
